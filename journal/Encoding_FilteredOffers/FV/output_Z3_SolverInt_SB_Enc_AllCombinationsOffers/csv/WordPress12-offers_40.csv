min_price = 3.316, price_vector = [0.128, 0.128, 0.128, 0.128, 0.128, 0.128, 0.128, 0.128, 0.128, 0.128, 0.128, 0.128, 0.128, 0.252, 0.128, 0.128, 0.128, 0.128, 0.252, 0.252, 0.128, 0.128, 0.128], time = 3323.209656715393 sec., vms_type = [37, 37, 37, 37, 37, 37, 37, 37, 37, 37, 37, 37, 37, 26, 37, 37, 37, 37, 27, 26, 37, 37, 37]
