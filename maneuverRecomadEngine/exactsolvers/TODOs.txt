In the paper:

1. Explain why MaxSMT encoding is not a solution also using A small case study from https://rise4fun.com/Z3/tutorial/optimization:
it should use RealBool with ite which is expensive
2. Why bit-vectors are expensive: we need to use the 32 bit since 16 might not be enough --> we can have values, e.g. hardware > 65536.
Then BV are expensive since of bit-blasting (flattening) -> encoding into SAT ==> many bool vars are introduced; actually
to avoid this blow-up integer encoding is used (see more details here https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~msagiv/courses/asv/z3py/guide-examples.htm)
(TODO tests BV)

what is old_bun ???

Do I have the latest version???

TODO: priority in constraints: In particular, cardinality constraints state that at most (at least, or exactly) k out of n propositional variables can be true.
